Both of the functions are boolean function. Thus, if there exists two elements in set S whose sum is exactly matched with target, then return true. If not, the function will return false.

For the brute force approach, an outer for loop will start from index 0, then a nested for loop will start from i+1 which means the inner for loop will start from index 1 in this case. Then inner for loop will add the value at index i and i+1 to check if the sum matched with the target value. If the sum matched, then return true and exit the program. This process will keep going until index i has iterate through the whole vector and did not find a pair that matched with target value, then exit the for loop and return false and exit the program.

For the efficient algorithm, a hash table that takes integer type for keys and data is created at first. A for loop will start iterating from index 0, first element of vector. Then, the difference between target value and value at index i will be stored into int diff. Then, a built-in function of unordered map: count, will be used to search for value of diff in the Hash Table. If the value of diff is found in the Hash Table, it means that there exist at least a pair of integers whose sum is exactly matched with target value, then return true and exit the program. Else, the value at index i will be store inside Hash Table with direct addressing. This process will keep going until the for loop has iterate through the whole vector and did not find a match, then return false and exit the program.
